public class MaximizeNegPnLMonths {
//    You are analyzing the market trends of Amazon stocks.
//    An AWS financial service model returned an array of integers, PnL (Profit and Loss),
//    for your portfolio representing that in the ith month, you will either gain or lose PnL[i].
//    All reported PnL values are positive, representing gains.

//    As part of the analysis, you will perform the following operation on the PnL array any number of times:
//    Choose any month (0 â‰¤ i < n) and multiply PnL[i] by -1
//    Find the maximum number of months you can afford to face a loss, i.e., have a negative PnL,
//    such that the cumulative PnL for each of the n months remains strictly positive i.e. remains greater than 0.
//
//    Note: The cumulative PnL for the ith month is defined as the sum of PnL from the starting month up to the ith month.
//    For example, the cumulative PnL for the PnL = [3, -2, 5, -6, 1] is [3, 1, 6, 0, 1].
//
//    Function Description
//
//    Complete the function maximizeNegativePnLMonths in the editor.
//
//    maximizeNegativePnLMonths has the following parameter:
//    int[] PnL: an array of integers representing the Profit and Loss for each month
//
//    Returns
//    int: the maximum number of months with a negative PnL such that the cumulative PnL remains positive
    public int maximizeNegativePnLMonths(int[] PnL) {
