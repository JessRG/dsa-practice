//    Amazon has recently established n distribution centers in a new location.
//    They want to set up 2 warehouses to serve these distribution centers.
//    Note that the centers and warehouses are all built along a straight line.
//    A distribution center has its demands met by the warehouse that is closest to it.
//    A logistics team wants to choose the location of the warehouses such that the sum of the distances
//    of the distribution centers to their closest warehouses is minimized.
//
//    Given an array dist_centers, that represent the positions of the distribution centers,
//    return the minimum sum of distances to their closest warehouses if the warehouses are positioned optimally.
//
//    Function Description
//    Complete the function getMinTotalDistance in the editor.
//    getMinTotalDistance has the following parameter:
//    int dist_centers[n]: the locations of the distribution centers
//
//    Returns
//    int: the minimum sum of distances
