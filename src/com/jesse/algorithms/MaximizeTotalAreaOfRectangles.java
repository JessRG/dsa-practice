//    Amazon games have introduced a new mathematical game for kids.
//    You will be given n sticks and the player is required to form rectangles from those sticks.
//
//    Formally, given an array of n integers representing the lengths of the sticks,
//    you are required to create rectangles using those sticks.
//    Note that a particular stick can be used in at most one rectangle and in order to
//    create a rectangle we must have exactly two pairs of sticks with the same lengths.
//    For example, you can create a rectangle using sticks of lengths [2, 2, 5, 5] and [4, 4, 4, 4] but not with [3, 3, 5, 8].
//    The goal of the game is to maximize the total sum of areas of all the rectangles formed.
//
//    In order to make the game more interesting, we are allowed to reduce any integer by at most 1.
//    Given the array sideLengths, representing the length of the sticks,
//    find the maximum sum of areas of rectangles that can be formed such that each element of the array
//    can be used as length or breadth of at most one rectangle and you are allowed to decrease
//    any integer by at most 1. Since this number can be quite large, return the answer modulo 10^9+7.
//
//    Note: It is not a requirement that all side lengths be used.
//    Also, a modulo b here represents the remainder obtained when an integer a is divided by an integer b.
//
//    Function Description
//    Complete the function getMaxTotalArea in the editor.
//
//    getMaxTotalArea has the following parameter(s):
//    int sideLengths[n]: the side lengths that can be used to form rectangles
//
//    Returns
//    int: the maximum total area of the rectangles that can be formed, modulo (109+7).
    public int getMaxTotalArea(int[] sideLengths) {
        // write your code here
        return 0;
    }
